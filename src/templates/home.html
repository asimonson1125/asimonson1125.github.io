        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Andrew Simonson<!--, CEO of the anti-thermodynamics syndicate.-->,
          a senior undergrad at
          <strong>Rochester Institute of Technology </strong>
          in the <b>Computer Science BS</b> program (international relations
          minor), pursuing a career in data science. I have study clusters in
          Data Science and AI and run independent studies in probability theory.
          <br />
          <br />
          I've worked on a variety of projects, from building analytical tools
          performing reactive chemical safety to live feed processing for
          frantic work environments looking to improve service. I also do
          personal experimentation leveraging open source info streams ranging
          from human traffic around campus to watershed temperature monitoring.
          <br />
          <br />
          My philosophy is that if it isn't explainable then you didn't learn
          anything. Data without sound methodology is at best meaningless and at
          worst counterproductive and costly. Bringing logical transparency and
          literal deductions back into digital analysis enables us to learn
          about the world through computing, rather than letting computers make
          decisions for the world we think we know. We as data scientists
          shouldn't just be building heuristics. We should be making discoveries
          and building new knowledge.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Bring the scientific method to AI.</strong>
